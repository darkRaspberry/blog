## Hi ðŸ‘‹

Hi again, On boring day with me learning JS for 100 days.

## What I learned today?
Things I find important and interesting today learning JS.
 - **Comma Operator (,)** We heard about other operators but not this one.
 - **Bitwise Operator** They use to do calculation in bit.(I hate those)
 - **`==` and `===` in JS**


### Comma Operators
In theory comma operator is really interesting. First let's see this code.

```js
var a = 4;
a = (a++, a, 15, "ram", a++);
console.log(a); // return 6
```
Comma operator execute code from left to right and returns the right most value.

### Bitwise Operator
These operator do calcualtion in bit and If you know how to calculate bit then its easy. More at [Mozilla docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_AND)

```js
//Bitwise Operator
console.log("\n****Bitwise Operators****")
console.log("Bitwise AND of 5 and 1: " + (5 & 1)) //returns 1 after calculation in binary.
console.log("Bitwise OR of 5 and 1: " + (5 | 1)) // returns 5 after calculation in binary.
console.log("Bitwise XOR of 5 and 1: " + (5 ^ 1)) //returns 4after calculation in binary.
```
Hope this gives a idea how it works.

### `==` and `===` in operator in JS
These operator looks so similar yet very interesting. Lets look at a example how it works.

```js
console.log(1 == 1); //returns true
console.log('1' == 1); //returns true
console.log(1 === 1); //returns true
console.log('1' === 1); //returns false
```
As we can see `==` compare two values irrespective of their data type. On the other hand `===` compare values on a strick manner and only returns true if both data type and value is same.

Byee for now. ðŸ‘‹
