## Hi ðŸ‘‹

Hi again, On another boring day with me learning JS for 100 days. Today's topic are very interesting keyword named as `this`. This will make your life easier when referring any variable in different places.

## What I learned today?
 - [`this` keyword](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/this) - helps to refer current object or current class.
 - `call()` & `apply()`
