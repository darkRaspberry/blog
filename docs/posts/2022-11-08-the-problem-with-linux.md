## Hi ðŸ‘‹

Hi today, I'm starting a new tag, `rant`.  These days I have a crisis, I have issue with every fucking thing, Like every fucking thing which exists. So here we are.

## Linux is not a PC yet?

Why did I even write this blog? Because I only have a Linux machine and there are times when I'm forced to use Windows to get work done, Hence this blog.

### Why do I think so?

The big tech companies just ignore the fact that Linux exist when they want and just support the whole Linux & open-source when they want. Like the entire fucking server in any cloud runs on Linux only. They do this to get the ultimate performance and get the most compute power possible from any CPU.

But when time comes to support it they just ignore the fact that it exist. They just do to cut cost and don't want to support a whole new desktop.

### What more?

Recently I gave exam of [Google Cloud Digital Leader](), a paid certification exam and the exam specifically ask me to have a Windows/Mac machine or choose a offline center. Although I had a option to choose offline one, I just don't want to go outside.

Ultimately, After crying on the Google Cloud Community page for few days. I cried in front of few friend and family members. After wiping my tears, I had to arrange a Windows machine and completed the exam.

## Reason - Market share!

At the time fo writing and according to my source, Currently Linux OS market share is just ~ 2 % making 3rd largest OS after Windows & Mac.

### So?

Reading this you might not able to see any issue, And that might we true. But the reason of Linux not actually supported is something to do with how Linux OS works.

Linux is open source and anyone can make a new OS and publish it. That makes a enormous amount of OS which are technically Linux but little different from other. This makes hundred not thousand types of different OS which doesn't support cross-OS packages. Some support `.deb` some use `aur` packages. Fucking fucked up.

Now any company can ultimately support a few type of packages, But at the end of day how many you support.

### Did Linux done anything to fix it?

Well the Linux community is fucking awesome, and they try to fix anything which is a threat to the Linux. They made `.appimage` which run on any Linux, and `flatpak`, `snap` and things like this. But these are not so mature so not supported by mainstream.


At the end of day all they say is, "Wait for good days."
