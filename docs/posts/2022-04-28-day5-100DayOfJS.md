## Hi ðŸ‘‹

Hi again, On another boring day with me learning JS for 100 days. Today's topic are one of our favorite `functions`. In this block and future block I will add links which will go to mozilla docs for better understanding.

## What I learned today?
 - **Functions** - Everything about functions.

### [Functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions)
Functions is a piece of code need to be defined once and repeated countless number of times.The interesting about them is in JS *Functions are objects.* They also have attribute and methods. Only difference is objects can't be called.

#### [Functions expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#function_expressions)

*Another interesting thing about functions is `Anonymous functions`*. Let's see the example of anonymous functions.

```js
const too = function func_name(){} // Normal function with a variables.
const foo = function(){} // Anonymous functions.
```
If we remember our first few blog we know variables JS is a dynamically typed language. Which means it can store many things like a whole functions as a variables. Wohoo ES6 rocks.

### [Arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Functions#arrow_functions)

These are just another way to define a function as a variable. If we look at an example we may get an idea how things works.

```js
var foo = (arg1, arg2) => {};
```
Although arrow functions can be written in many format depending on parameter and function definitions. In the end note, arrow functions intimidate me in the dark mid-nights. So we will come back at this arrow functions.
## Bye for now.
