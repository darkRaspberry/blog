## Hi ðŸ‘‹

Hi again, On another boring day with me learning JS for 100 days. Today's topic are lil tough but please stay with me. Sorry for the late and small blog, Will try to fullfil it tomorrow.

## What I learned today?
 - Use of alias in Component Destructuring.

### Use of alias in Component Destructuring
Destructuring is a complex things. To understand lets first see why we use it. When there is lots of properties in a component. It's a tedious task to assign or access any one properties in that component. So we use destructuring to access the properties directly.

```js
const example = {
  name: 'Ram',
  roll: '1',
  class: 'lkg',};
const {name,roll,class} = example; //Normal method to access example components.
console.log(name,roll,class)//Output --> Ram 1 lkg
const {name:n} = example; //we use : to make an alias.
console.log(n); //Output --> Ram
```

Here we can see how we can use alias to access it. From next blog we will learn about functions yay.

## Bye for now.
