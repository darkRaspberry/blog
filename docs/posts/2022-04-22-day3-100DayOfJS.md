## Hi ðŸ‘‹

Hi again, On another boring day with me learning JS for 100 days. Today's topic are lil tough but please stay with me.

## What I learned today?
 - **Spread Operator(`...`)** Something I didn't understand but want to use.

### Spread Operators (`...`)
They can make array lil less intimidating for you. Basically they can add or concat objects and helps to make new objects. Lets see this in action.

```js
a = [1,2,3];
b = [4,5,6];
c = a.concat(b); // Simple way to concatenate.
c = [...a, ...b]; //Using spread operators

console.log("c: " + c); // Outputs -->c: 1,2,3,4,5,6
```

So, It can combine array pretty cool right

```js
const person = { name: "John"};
const student = { ID: "21", GPA: "3.0"};

const new = { ...person, ...student, semester: '3'};
console.log(new); //Output --> { name: 'Jhon', ID: '21', GPA: '3.0', semester: '3' }
```

##### Why Spread Operator is nice.
 - I can clone as `b = [...a]`.
 - I can add elements and clone as `b = [...a,'new',..a]`.
 - It is just nice.

## Bye for now.
